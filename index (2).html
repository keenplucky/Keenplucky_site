    <p>
        Tahoora Ahadi, born on November 26, 2001, in Shemiranat, Tehran, began painting at the age of three.
        With a mind full of stories, she tried to express them through her art and later flourished as a writer.
        Her published books include "My Wings" and "The Destructive Hand". Her play "The Blue Rose" was written for the Fajr Festival.
        Her art style combines surrealism, impressionism, and cubism, often addressing philosophical or narrative themes.
        She achieved first place in the national practical arts entrance exam in 2020.
        Tahoora sees art as a path to spiritual elevation and believes that "painters reveal the secrets of paper and canvas".
